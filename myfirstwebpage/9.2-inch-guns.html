9.2 inch guns formed the largest category of guns in Singapore, with a total of 9 guns in Singapore. Built begtween 1910 and 1936, these guns were used the heavist during the battle of Singapore. The guns had a range of 21 miles, shooting a shell weling 1700lbs at enemy ships. Unforunately, the wrong ammunication was used during WW2. Instead of high explosive rounds, armour piercing rounds were used which had little effects on troop concentraions.  </p>

<p>Each gun was sat in a gun emplacement, 100ft wide, 30 feet deep, with a labrinyth of tunnels, shell hoist systems, magazine and cartridge stores and gunner's shelters, up to 60ft beneath the ground. Many of these structures and their underground rooms exist, but their locations remain a tightly guarded secret.

	<p> An investigation by Lukas Menkhoff in 2016 uncovered the remains of the site, deep within the rainforest. 1 of the guns were found intact in 2017, retaining its origininal structure with minimal structural damange. The other two guns at the site were blown up in 1942, leaving a massive 100ft deep crater in its place. </p>
