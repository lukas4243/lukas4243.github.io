<div><p> AMTBs protected entraces to Singapore's waters with their dual 6-inch guns, able to shoot as fast moving motorboats (hence the name). 9 AMTBs were constructed between 1890 and 1935, adding to the already impressive fortications of the 9.2-inch nad 15-inch guns around Singapore. Many of the AMTBs helped provide fire at enemy troops, and took part it shelling fuel stores to render them useless to the Japanese. This page outlines the remaining AMTBs in Singapore: </p>

<div><h3> Extracts from the Faber Fire Command War Diary (Ladang Battery)</h3>
<p> <h4> 13 Feb 42 </h4>
"The FC gave orders for Batu Berlayer to prepare for demolition”.
“At 2230 hrs orders were issued to carry out demolitions, and for Batu Berlayer Sections, to withdraw on completion to Berhala Reping on Blakan Mati....”. The guns were spiked. <span class="severity">“No 1 gun split ......and the muzzle of No 2 was completely blown off”. The first attempt to fire the magazine failed so a trail of cordite was laid to try again. This worked and the magazine was left in flames. </span> The D.E.Ls. and the Engine Room were also destroyed. Personnel were taken by tongkang to Siloso Pier. From there, they went on to form a defensive position round Hospital Hill. Later they were withdrawn to Berhala Reping. Following the British Surrender, Captain Pickard and several men from Batu Berlayer escaped by launch.</p> </div>

<div><h3> Post War Survey</h3>
<p> In 1946, Colonel Rice visted all the fortication sites in Singapores, noting their condition for repair as the British started to regain possession of the island back from the Japanese. Post war, Colonel F.W. Rice in his 1946 Report entitled, “Singapore and Penang Coast Artillery”, regarding the Tanjong Tereh AMTB that no armament had been installed, and the the one searchlight emplacement he could find was serviceable. It would seem from his report that he expected to find two. He noted, “It would appear that the second emplacement was not constructed”. He found the complete gun emplacement undamaged.

Colonel Rice recommended that Tanjong Tereh be armed with a Twin 6 Pounder as part of interim defences of Singapore. This was not done.

Nothing remains of Tanjong Tereh today. Its location is in Brani Container Port. </p></div>
