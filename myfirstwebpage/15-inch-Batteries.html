<div> <h3> The Guns </h3>
<p> The 15-inch guns consisted of the two sites, <span class="location"> the Johore Battery and the Buona Vista Battery.</span> The Johore Battery was a former British coastal artillery battery located in Changi on the easternmost side of mainland Singapore. It consisted of three large BL 15-inch Mk. I naval guns installed on land by the British government in the late 1930s to defend the approaching path to the east of the island to their large naval base located at Sembawang in the north (accessed via the Johor Straits) from an attacking enemy naval force. The following guns onced existed in Singapore: </p>


<p> <ul>
	<li> Johore Battery Gun No.1 </li>
	<li> Johore Battery Gun No.2 </li>
	<li> Johore Battery Gun No.3 </li>
	<li> Buona Vista Gun No.1 </li>
	<li> Buona Vista Gun No.2 </li>
</ul> </p> </div>

<div><h4> History </h4>
<p>Built by the British government in 1939 for the naval defence of Singapore (in particular, to defend Singapore from an aggressive Imperial Japan, which had possessed a strong and a powerful navy by the later part of the 1930s and was expanding deeper and deeper into China), the Johore Battery is a large gun emplacement site consisting of a labyrinth of underground tunnels. These tunnels were used to store quantities of ammunition for the three 15-inch guns (most of which were of the armour-piercing (AP) type rather than the high-explosive (HE) type as these naval guns were intended to be employed against heavily armoured enemy warships). </p></div>

<div><h4> Conservation </h4> 
<p> A replica of the large naval gun and a dummy 15-inch shell, placed upon a modern large lifting-lever (allowing visitors to have a feel of its mass (of 800kg) by trying to hoist it up from the ground), together with the maze of above-ground trails marking where the old (and still-inaccessible) tunnels are at, are all located at the former site of the Johore Battery, along with a newly-opened restaurant located just beside it within the compound (access to the area is through a small hut-like structure with a plaque telling the history of and all about the old Johore Battery). Admission to the site is free and is open from 9:00am until 5:00pm, Monday to Friday.[citation needed].</p></div>
